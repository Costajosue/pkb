## Welcome to my JAVASCRIPT repository!

This repository was created to showcase all learning and study about Javascript which is an interpreted, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It is widely used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Together with HTML (structure) and CSS (style), JavaScript forms the fundamental trio for web development.
