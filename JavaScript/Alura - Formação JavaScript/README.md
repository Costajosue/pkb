In this repository I will be showing all the content learned about the course I took with the theme: From scratch: beginner in programming whose objective is to transmit and teach programming logic along with the most used programming languages â€‹â€‹in the world. Furthermore, I also had the opportunity to learn how to use GitHub, an online platform for hosting and collaborating on software development projects. With this I had the opportunity to learn Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## Topics studied and worked on in the courses:

#### Course: Programming Logic using the Javascript language:

* Interactively display on-screen messages;
* Use variables in software development;
* Enter the world of development by following good programming practices;
* Develop an application from start to finish, inspired by the real world;
* Learn how to adapt solutions developed by the language into your software programs.


With this I carried out a project in Javascript where the aim was to build the entire back-end part of a guessing game where the user can choose 0 to 5000 and thus the machine will generate a random number and the user will try to guess it, so in the end If the user guesses the secret number, a screen 'you got it right!' will be displayed. '.

I also performed some exercises and a challenge, to consolidate what was learned from the course.
